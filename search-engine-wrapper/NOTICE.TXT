SEARCH ENGINE WRAPPER

IMPORTANT NOTICES
-----------------

1. Changes to API related to search engine clients

As of the releases of 2013 April 23, the design of the search engine client
classes and its associated classes have been redesigned. The changes are
necessary to better support Twitter-style search engine APIs. As a result, a
set of backwards incompatible changes were introduced in the API related to the
search engine clients. However, the API for using the search engine wrapper is
unaffected.

2. Changes to search engine wrapper behaviour and search engine results output
   XML file format.

From the releases of 2010 March 30 and onwards, the search engine wrapper
attempts to detect fatal errors returned by search engines, where queries
should not be retried. Instead, the output XML file now contains a new element
<fatalerror>, which indicates whether a fatal error has occurred.

3. Other changes to search engine results output XML file format

Starting from the release of 2009 September 30, the format of the search engine
results output XML file changed in two ways. Firstly, the search engine wrapper
now combines multiple SearchEngineResults objects belonging to the same query
but differing start index into one single SearchEngineResults object, and
hence the XML file will contain only one <results> element for each query in the
input file as opposed to having multiple <results> element for each query as
previously done. Secondly, the search engine wrapper now outputs XML files that
are actually well-formed, and hence accepted by XML parsers. This is done
through two new classes ResultsXMLReader and ResultsXMLWriter, and backwards
compatibility is maintained with the legacy SearchEngineResultsXML class such
that the output of SearchEngineResultsXML is readable by ResultsXMLReader and
the output of ResultsXMLWriter is readable by SearchEngineResultsXML. Note that
the legacy SearchEngineResultsXML class is now removed.

Starting from the release of 2009 June 9, the search engine results output XML
file will be saved using the UTF-8 character encoding. Releases prior to 2009
June 9 have saved the XML file using the platform default encoding. While
releases of 2009 June 9 and later will be able to read XML files saved by
earlier releases without loss of information, earlier releases may not be able
to correctly read XML files saved by releases of 2009 June 9 and later if the
platform default encoding is not UTF-8 and the XML files contain characters
outside the ASCII character set.


POTENTIAL ISSUES WHEN USING THE SEARCH ENGINE WRAPPER
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Repeated failures with key rotation

If there is more than one key, then these keys will be rotated when there is
repeated failures during querying, and the program will only terminate when all
queries have successfully returned results. Users running this program in the
background are advised to periodically check the standard output and error
output in case the failure is not caused by transient downtime such as temporary
server issues or daily quota exceeded for a key.
