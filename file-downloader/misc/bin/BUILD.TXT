BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------

The build instructions assumes that a recent version of Apache Ant
(http://ant.apache.org/) is already installed and properly configured on your
system. If build errors occur, you may need to download and install the latest
version of Apache Ant.

If "ant" is already in your PATH environment variable, all you need to build
this Java package is to execute the following command from the directory
containing the "build.xml" file:
    ant

By default, the "ant" command executes the "build" task followed by the "dist"
task. The "build" task compiles the Java sources into a .jar file, copies any
other requisite .jar files over, and generate the Javadocs, with all output
files placed in a subdirectory named "build". The "dist" task generates both the
binary and source distributions as .zip files, placed under the subdirectory
"dist".

The Apache Ant build file "build.xml" is designed to be self-replicating, in the
sense that a source distribution builds an exact replica of itself.


DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------

To facilitate the self-replication of the source distribution, the directory
containing "build.xml" must contain the following subdirectories:
- src: The source code for this package.
- lib: The .jar files required by this package.
- res: The files that are to be copied into the .jar file of this package. These
  may include model files that need to be loaded when executing this package.
- misc/bin: The files that are to be copied into the binary distribution. These
  may include usage instructions.
- misc/src: The files that are to be copied into the source distribution. These
  may include build instructions.
All of the above subdirectories must exist, but some of them can be empty.

Upon executing the "build" task, a "build" subdirectory will be created and the
following events will occur:
 1. The source code under "src" will be compiled to "build/classes".
 2. The files under "res" will be copied to "build/classes".
 3. The files under "build/classes" will be archived into a .jar file under
    "build".
 4. The files under "lib" will be copied to "build".
 5. The Javadocs will be generated under "build/doc" from the source code.

Upon executing the "dist" task, a "dist" subdirectory will be created and the
following events will occur:
 1. The .jar files under "build" will be copied to "dist/bin/[package name]".
 2. The "build/doc" directory will be copied to "dist/bin/[package name]".
 3. The files under "misc/bin" will be copied to "dist/bin/[package name]".
 4. The directory "dist/bin/[package name]" will be archived into a binary
    distribution .zip file under "dist".
 5. The "src" directory will be copied to "dist/src/[package name]".
 6. The "res" directory will be copied to "dist/src/[package name]".
 7. The "lib" directory will be copied to "dist/src/[package name]".
 8. The "misc" directory will be copied to "dist/src/[package name]".
 9. The files under "misc/src" will be copied to "dist/src/[package name]".
10. The directory "dist/src/[package name]" will be archived into a source
    distribution .zip file under "dist".
